          <h4>Summary of Report</h4>
          <p>The AI4WIA Bootcamp, launched to empower Nigeria Female students in Artificial Intelligence (AI) / Machine
            Learning (ML) and its application in the smart climate and agricultural sector. The bootcamp commenced with
            a robust call for participants. Following a meticulous selection process of selected 136 candidates from 186
            applicants, the selection was based on criteria such as academic background and motivation. The bootcamp
            officially began on August 30th with an introductory meeting and pre-assessment evaluations. Subsequent
            activities introduced participants to accessing free courses on Coursera, training on the fundamental of AI
            and ML concepts, and practical applications in weather forecasting. Through collaborative projects, a
            hackathon, and virtual presentations, participants showcased their mastery of AI and ML, culminating in a
            closure and award ceremony on January 21st, 2024. The AI4WIA Bootcamp equipped participants with valuable
            skills and also fostered a supportive learning community, inspiring continued growth and innovation in AI
            and ML among Nigeria Female Students.</p>
          <h4>Introduction to Boot Camp Activities</h4>
          <p>The AI4WIA Bootcamp emerged as a response to the pressing need for leveraging Artificial Intelligence (AI)
            and Machine Learning (ML) in revolutionizing the climatic change effects on agricultural landscape.
            Recognizing the critical role of women in agriculture and the untapped potential of AI technologies, the
            bootcamp aimed to empower women with the knowledge and skills to address challenges and drive innovation in
            this vital sector. The program began with a comprehensive call for participants, attracting a diverse pool
            of applicants eager to contribute to the intersection of AI and agriculture. Amidst this enthusiasm, a
            problem statement emerged: despite advancements in AI and ML, their application in agriculture, particularly
            in the context of women's participation, remained underexplored. Thus, the bootcamp sought to bridge this
            gap by equipping participants with the requisite expertise to harness AI and ML for sustainable agricultural
            practices while empowering women to take center stage in this transformative journey.</p>

          <p style="text-align:center;">Table 1: AI4WIA Bootcamp Planned Activities</p>
          <p>The bootcamp's journey began with the crucial task of issuing a call for participants, spanning from the 21st to the 28th of August, 2023. This period was dedicated to spreading awareness about the program and inviting individuals interested in enhancing their skills in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML). Through targeted outreach efforts and promotional activities, a comprehensive list of applicants was compiled, setting the stage for the next phase of the program.</p>
          <p>Following the call for participants, the application process closed on the 28th of August, 2023. This marked the deadline for aspiring participants to submit their applications, ensuring that 186 interested individuals had the opportunity to register for the bootcamp. The closure of applications signified the beginning of the selection process, where the organizing team meticulously reviewed each application to shortlist candidates who demonstrated the potential to benefit from the program.</p>
          <p>The shortlisting of successful applicants took place from the 28th to the 29th of August, 2023. During this phase, the organizing team carefully evaluated each application based on predetermined criteria, such as academic background, relevant experience, and motivation. By identifying candidates who met the program's requirements, the shortlisting process ensured that the selected 136 participants were well-suited to engage effectively with the bootcamp's curriculum and activities.</p>
          <p>With the shortlisted candidates identified, the next step involves inviting them to participate in the bootcamp. This involved sending out invitations and facilitating their inclusion in relevant communication channels, such as mailing lists and WhatsApp groups. The invitation process, conducted on the 28th and 29th of August, 2023, aimed to ensure that all selected participants were informed about the program's schedule, expectations, and logistics, fostering a sense of belonging and anticipation among the cohort.</p>
          <p>On the 30th of August, 2023, the bootcamp officially commenced with the 1st introduction meeting with participants. This session served as a platform for participants to acquaint themselves with the program's objectives, activities, and expectations. Additionally, participants were introduced to the pre-assessment evaluation form, which provided insights into their existing knowledge and skills in AI and ML, guiding the customization of the bootcamp experience to meet their needs.</p>
          <p>Continuing the journey, participants were introduced to Coursera on the 30th and 31st of August, 2023. This phase focused on guiding participants through the registration process and facilitating their application for financial aid, ensuring equitable access to the educational resources offered through the platform. By familiarizing participants with Coursera's interface and functionalities, this activity empowered them to leverage online learning opportunities to complement their bootcamp experience.</p>
          <p>The bootcamp's curriculum delved into the fundamentals of AI and ML from the 31st of August to the 2nd of September, 2023. Through a series of interactive sessions, participants received a comprehensive introduction to key concepts, methodologies, and applications in these fields. Accompanied by PowerPoint slides and recorded video lectures, this activity provided participants with a solid foundation for further exploration and engagement in subsequent sessions.</p>
          <p>Expanding on the application of AI and ML, participants were introduced to weather forecasting applications from the 4th to the 5th of September, 2023.
