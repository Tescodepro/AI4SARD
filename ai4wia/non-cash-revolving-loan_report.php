                    <h4>Summary of Report</h4>
                    <p>TThe report describes the implementation of a non-cash revolving mechanism for women farmers at
                        Kwara State University under the “Artificial Intelligence for Women in Agriculture” project
                        funded by the Gender Responsible Artificial grant Intelligence Network (GRAIN), the program
                        aimed at empowering women farmers by providing them with agricultural inputs rather than
                        monetary assistance.</p>

                    <p>Following training sessions for women farmers, an application process was launched, with 12
                        applications submitting forms. Two applicants were disqualified for requesting monetary
                        assistance contrary to the terms of the program. Ten applicants were then selected to interact
                        with a panel of researchers, and two others were eliminated due to their insufficient ability to
                        immediately use the contributions.</p>

                    <p>Six applicants were chosen for the non-monetary facility programme, representing various
                        agricultural sectors including crop production, fish farming and poultry farming. Each selected
                        farmer received specific inputs tailored to their farming activities, such as maize seeds,
                        fertilizers, herbicides, pumping machine, smoking kiln, day-old chicks, feed and vaccines.</p>
                    <p>The opening ceremony for the first batch of the program took place on February 1, 2024, during
                        which agricultural inputs totaling 992,100 Naira were distributed to selected women farmers
                        based on their respective agricultural enterprises.</p>
